Strategies for code reuse in micro services architecture

When we consider several Microservice teams, we want each team to operate with minimal dependencies between each other. However, when we reuse code across Microservices, we fall into the trap of dependence, which could potentially disrupt the independence and agility of Microservice teams. Therefore, the challenge is to find the right balance between reuse and reliance.
